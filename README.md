# crbrs ü¶Ä - A Cross-Platform CRBasic Toolchain

A modern, cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) toolchain for developing programs for Campbell Scientific dataloggers using CRBasic, written in Rust.

## Motivation

Programming Campbell Scientific dataloggers often involves using proprietary Windows-based GUI tools (like the CRBasic Editor) which can feel dated and don't integrate well with modern development workflows.

`crbrs` aims to provide a better development experience by offering:

*   A **command-line interface** for common tasks like compiling, managing compilers, and (eventually) interacting with dataloggers.
*   **Cross-platform compatibility**, enabling development on macOS (including Apple Silicon/M1+ and Intel), Linux, and Windows.
*   Integration with modern text editors like **VS Code** (initially via external tasks, planned LSP support).
*   A way to manage different **compiler versions** needed for various datalogger families and OS versions.

## Features

*   **Compiler Management:**
    *   List available compilers from a remote manifest (`compilers.toml`).
    *   Install specific compiler versions into a managed directory.
    *   List locally installed compilers.
    *   Remove installed compilers.
*   **Compilation Wrapper:**
    *   Compile `.cr*` files using the appropriate installed compiler.
    *   Automatically uses **Wine** on macOS/Linux to run the Windows-based Campbell Scientific compilers.
    *   Handles compiler selection based on file extension associations or explicit flags.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Manage settings via a `config.toml` file (e.g., compiler repository URL, Wine path).
    *   Associate specific file extensions (`.cr2`, `.cr300`, etc.) with installed compiler IDs.
*   **(Planned) Datalogger Communication:**
    *   Flash compiled programs to loggers via Serial/USB.
    *   Retrieve data tables from loggers.
*   **(Planned) Language Server (LSP):**
    *   Provide basic CRBasic language support (diagnostics via background compilation) for LSP-compatible editors like VS Code.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **Rust Toolchain:** Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2.  **Wine (macOS/Linux only):** Required to run the Campbell Scientific compilers. Install it through your system's package manager (e.g., `brew install wine-stable` on macOS, `sudo apt install wine` on Debian/Ubuntu). `crbrs` will try to find `wine` in your PATH, or you can specify the path via `crbrs config set wine_path /path/to/wine`.

### From Crates.io (Recommended - *Once Published*)

```bash
cargo install crbrs-cli
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rileyleff/crbrs.git
cd crbrs
cargo build --release
# The binary will be in ./target/release/crbrs-cli
# You can copy it to a location in your PATH, e.g., ~/.cargo/bin/
# cp target/release/crbrs-cli ~/.cargo/bin/crbrs
```

## Configuration

`crbrs` uses a configuration file (`config.toml`) stored in a standard user config location.

*   **Find Config Path:** `crbrs config path`
*   **Show Current Config:** `crbrs config show`

### Key Setting: Compiler Repository URL

`crbrs` needs to know where to find the `compilers.toml` manifest file. It defaults to an example URL. You should point it to the manifest provided by the companion repository:

1.  **Get the Raw URL:** Go to [github.com/rileyleff/campbell-scientific-compilers](https://github.com/rileyleff/campbell-scientific-compilers), navigate to `compilers.toml`, click "Raw", and copy the URL.
2.  **Set the URL:**
    ```bash
    crbrs config set compiler_repository_url <PASTE_RAW_URL_HERE>
    ```

### Other Settings

*   `wine_path`: (Optional) Explicit path to the `wine` executable if not in your system PATH.
*   `compiler_storage_path`: (Optional) Override the default location where compiler zips are unpacked.
*   `file_associations`: Map file extensions to compiler IDs (see Usage).

## Usage

```bash
# General Help
crbrs --help
crbrs compile --help
crbrs compiler --help
crbrs config --help

# --- Compiler Management ---

# List compilers available in the remote repository
crbrs compiler list-available

# Install a specific compiler (ID from list-available)
crbrs compiler install cr300comp

# List compilers installed locally
crbrs compiler list

# Remove a locally installed compiler
crbrs compiler remove cr300comp

# --- Configuration ---

# Show current settings
crbrs config show

# Show path to config file
crbrs config path

# Set the compiler repository URL
crbrs config set compiler_repository_url <URL>

# Set the path to Wine (if needed)
crbrs config set wine_path /opt/local/bin/wine

# Associate .cr2 files with the 'cr2comp-v10s' compiler
crbrs config set-association --extension cr2 --compiler-id cr2comp-v10s

# Remove an association
crbrs config unset-association --extension cr2

# --- Compilation ---

# Compile using the associated compiler for .cr2
crbrs compile my_program.cr2

# Compile and specify an output log file
crbrs compile my_program.cr2 --output-log compile_log.txt

# Compile using a specific compiler, overriding association
crbrs compile my_other_program.cr2 --compiler cr2comp-cr200x-std-04
```

## Compiler Repository

The actual Campbell Scientific compiler binaries are managed in a separate repository:

‚û°Ô∏è [github.com/rileyleff/campbell-scientific-compilers](https://github.com/rileyleff/campbell-scientific-compilers)

This repository contains:

*   The `compilers.toml` manifest file that `crbrs` reads.
*   Scripts to package compilers.
*   Automation (GitHub Actions) to create GitHub Releases.
*   The **compiler binaries themselves hosted as assets** on the GitHub Releases page of that repository.

Please refer to that repository's README for details on compiler licensing and management.

## Future Work / Roadmap

*   [ ] Implement actual compilation execution logic (calling the compiler via Wine/natively).
*   [ ] Implement datalogger communication (flashing, data retrieval).
*   [ ] Develop a basic Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation.
*   [ ] Add more robust error handling and reporting.
*   [ ] Publish `crbrs-cli` to crates.io.
*   [ ] Provide pre-built binaries via GitHub Releases for `crbrs`.

## Contributing

Contributions (bug reports, feature requests, pull requests) are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rileyleff/crbrs/issues).
